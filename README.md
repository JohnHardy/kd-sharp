# kd-sharp
This is a very fast pure C# kd-tree with no dependencies.  

It also comes with a sample application where you can play with the numbers and perform some nearest neighbor queries.

This is a C# port of [http://robowiki.net/wiki/User:Rednaxela Rednaxela's] kd-tree for Java https://bitbucket.org/rednaxela/knn-benchmark

Since Google Code has removed 'Downloads' for new projects, casual users can get the sample app here.
